## Introduction
Internet checker is a simple script I made to either check the status of my internet and have it alert me when it comes back up or check the status of a specific site that's temporarily unavailable.


All you need to run this script is python and playsound library

## Setup

```bash
pip install playsound==1.2.2
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xHondaa/InternetChecker
```

## Usage
```bash
InternetChecker\main.py
```
Then open "C:\Users\*User*\InternetChecker\main.py"

## Modification
You can open the main.py file with any text editor and you will find comments on specific parts you can change to suit your needs such as the method it asks for the delay between each time it checks and the site it checks from
